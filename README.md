# Intermittent "Network request failed" Error in React Native

This repository demonstrates an intermittent "Network request failed" error in a React Native application. The error occurs inconsistently, even with a stable network connection.

## Problem

The app uses `fetch` to make API calls to an external endpoint.  Under normal circumstances, the API requests should succeed. However, the app sporadically crashes with a network error, making debugging difficult.

## Solution

The provided solution addresses this by implementing more robust error handling and a retry mechanism for network requests.
